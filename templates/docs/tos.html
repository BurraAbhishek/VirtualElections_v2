            <p1>
                This software is <a href="/source/">free and open-source</a>,
                with the express purpose of conducting elections remotely. This
                means that in addition to using our website and its features,
                technologies or software for free (collectively, the
                “services”), you can also inspect, copy, and (within certain
                licensing requirements) use our source code.

            <br />
            <br />
            <p1>
                These Terms of Service (Terms) are a legally binding agreement
                made by and between us and you individually, and if it
                additionally applies to you, any organisation or entity you
                represent (collectively, “you”). This page governs your use of
                our website and the Services that we offer, so take care to read
                through it carefully. Although in some places we've had to use
                certain legal phrasing and terminology for these Terms to be
                valid, overall we've done our best to explain everything in
                clear everyday English.

            <p1>
                By accessing or using any part of this website or our services,
                we take that to mean that you have read, understood, and agree
                to contract with us on the basis of these Terms. If you do not
                agree, do not use our website or services. From time to time, we
                may need to make changes to these Terms. We will edit the “last
                modified” date when we do, and if you continue using our website
                and/or services after that, we will take that to mean you have
                accepted the changes to our contract.
